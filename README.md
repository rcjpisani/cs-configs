# Argwhar's CS:GO configs

These are my configs for CS:GO, which consist of 5 different parts:

* autoexec.cfg
* binds.cfg
* buy.cfg
* training.cfg
* lagfix.cfg

### Description

---
##### autoexec.cfg
This config contains all of the settings I want to load when the game first initializes. Sets up stuff like crosshair, HUD placement, non-traditional binds, etc...

---
##### binds.cfg
Contains all the default binds that are overridden by the buy.cfg when the ALT key is pressed (see the "BUY BINDS" section in autoexec.cfg)

---
##### buy.cfg
All the binds used during buy time is setup here, to activate the binds, hold the ALT key while pressing any one of the keys in this config to buy the selected item. Releasing ALT will activate binds.cfg, which will re-bind your keys to the defaults. Again, see the "BUY BINDS" section in autoexec.cfg

---
##### training.cfg
A training config to setup some stuff like round time, infinite ammo, grenade trajectory, etc. to be used in a training session by yourself or with friends.

---
##### lagfix.cfg
A config to load when experiencing a drastic FPS drop during a game. It sets the game to windowed mode, then back to fullscreen mode which fixes the issue. Haven't had to use this lately, but leaving it here just in case. Configure the resolution to the resolution of your choice.

---

### Installation

Simply move the .cfg files into the cfg folder where your CS:GO installation resides!
